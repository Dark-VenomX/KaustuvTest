# 1) Mention the working of Internet Website in Terms of Front-end & Back-end Divisions 
Soln. The working of an internet website involves the collaboration of front-end and back-end divisions. Here's an overview of their roles:

Front-end: The front-end of a website refers to the client-side portion that users interact with directly. It encompasses the user interface, design, and overall user experience. The front-end technologies mainly include HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript.

When a user accesses a website through their browser, the front-end code is delivered to their device. The HTML defines the structure and content of the web page, the CSS determines its visual appearance and layout, and the JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior. The browser interprets these files and renders the website, displaying the visual elements, text, images, and interactive features to the user.

Users can interact with the website's front-end through forms, buttons, navigation menus, and other interface elements. The front-end communicates with the back-end to send and receive data, enabling dynamic functionality and personalized experiences.

Back-end: The back-end of a website refers to the server-side portion that handles the behind-the-scenes operations. It involves the server infrastructure, database management, and processing of user requests. The back-end technologies commonly include programming languages like Python, Ruby, PHP, or Java, along with frameworks and libraries specific to those languages.

When a user interacts with the front-end, such as submitting a form or requesting specific data, the front-end sends a request to the back-end server. The back-end processes the request, performs necessary operations (e.g., database queries, business logic), and generates a response. This response is then sent back to the front-end, which can update the website's content accordingly.

The back-end manages data storage, authentication and authorization, business logic implementation, and any additional server-side operations required for the website's functionality. It ensures the secure and efficient processing of user requests, providing the necessary data to the front-end for display.

In summary, the front-end focuses on the user interface, design, and interactivity, while the back-end handles server-side operations, data processing, and communication with databases or external services. The combination of these divisions enables the functioning of an internet website, delivering a seamless and interactive experience to users.
