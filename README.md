### 1) Mention the working of Internet Website in Terms of Front-end & Back-end Divisions 
Soln. The working of an internet website involves the collaboration of front-end and back-end divisions. Here's an overview of their roles:

Front-end: The front-end of a website refers to the client-side portion that users interact with directly. It encompasses the user interface, design, and overall user experience. The front-end technologies mainly include HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript.

When a user accesses a website through their browser, the front-end code is delivered to their device. The HTML defines the structure and content of the web page, the CSS determines its visual appearance and layout, and the JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior. The browser interprets these files and renders the website, displaying the visual elements, text, images, and interactive features to the user.

Users can interact with the website's front-end through forms, buttons, navigation menus, and other interface elements. The front-end communicates with the back-end to send and receive data, enabling dynamic functionality and personalized experiences.

Back-end: The back-end of a website refers to the server-side portion that handles the behind-the-scenes operations. It involves the server infrastructure, database management, and processing of user requests. The back-end technologies commonly include programming languages like Python, Ruby, PHP, or Java, along with frameworks and libraries specific to those languages.

When a user interacts with the front-end, such as submitting a form or requesting specific data, the front-end sends a request to the back-end server. The back-end processes the request, performs necessary operations (e.g., database queries, business logic), and generates a response. This response is then sent back to the front-end, which can update the website's content accordingly.

The back-end manages data storage, authentication and authorization, business logic implementation, and any additional server-side operations required for the website's functionality. It ensures the secure and efficient processing of user requests, providing the necessary data to the front-end for display.

In summary, the front-end focuses on the user interface, design, and interactivity, while the back-end handles server-side operations, data processing, and communication with databases or external services. The combination of these divisions enables the functioning of an internet website, delivering a seamless and interactive experience to users.

### 2) What are tags in HTML? Explain each category of tag with an Example. 
Soln. In HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), tags are used to define the structure and elements of a web page. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< >) and consist of an opening tag and, in some cases, a closing tag. The opening tag denotes the start of an element, while the closing tag indicates its end. Some HTML tags, like <br>, are self-closing and do not require a closing tag.

Here are examples of different categories of HTML tags:

•	Heading Tags: Used to define headings or titles within a document, ranging from h1 (highest importance) to h6 (lowest importance). Example:
<h1>This is a Heading</h1>

•	Paragraph Tag: Used to define paragraphs of text. Example:
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>

•	Anchor Tag: Used to create hyperlinks to other web pages or resources. Example:
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>

•	Image Tag: Used to insert images into a web page. Example:
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">

•	List Tags: Used to create ordered (numbered) or unordered (bullet) lists. Example of an unordered list:
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>

•	Table Tags: Used to create tables for tabular data. Example:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Header 1</th>
    <th>Header 2</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Data 1</td>
    <td>Data 2</td>
  </tr>
</table>

•	Form Tags: Used to create interactive forms for user input. Example:
<form action="/submit" method="post">
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name"><br>
  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email"><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

### 3) Explain the working Procedure of Virtual DOM. 
Soln. The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a concept used in web development frameworks, such as React, to optimize the rendering process of web pages. The Virtual DOM acts as an abstraction layer between the actual HTML DOM (Document Object Model) and the developer's code.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the working procedure of the Virtual DOM:

•	Initial rendering: When the web application starts or when a component is first rendered, the Virtual DOM is created as an in-memory representation of the HTML DOM. It replicates the structure of the actual DOM, but it is not directly linked to the browser's rendering engine.

•	Updating the state: When a user interacts with the application, such as clicking a button or entering text into a form, the application's state is updated. This triggers a re-rendering process.

•	Reconciliation: When a re-render is required, the Virtual DOM compares the updated component's state with its previous state. It identifies the differences or updates that need to be made to the component's structure.

•	Virtual DOM diffing: The Virtual DOM performs a process called "diffing" to efficiently determine the minimum number of changes needed to update the actual HTML DOM. It compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous Virtual DOM representation and identifies the changes in the component structure.

•	Update the actual DOM: Once the differences are identified, the Virtual DOM calculates the most efficient way to update the actual HTML DOM. It creates a batch of DOM manipulation instructions, optimizing the number of changes needed.

•	Apply changes to the DOM: The batched changes are then applied to the real DOM all at once, rather than individually. This minimizes the number of browser reflows or repaints, which can be expensive operations in terms of performance.

By utilizing the Virtual DOM, web frameworks can reduce the number of direct manipulations to the actual DOM, which can be slow and inefficient. Instead, changes are made to the lightweight Virtual DOM, and only the necessary updates are propagated to the real DOM. This approach improves performance by minimizing the time spent on costly DOM operations and enhances the overall user experience.

The Virtual DOM concept helps simplify the development process, improves rendering efficiency, and enables a more responsive and performant web application.

### 4) Mention some Differences between MySQL and No SQL 
Soln. MySQL and NoSQL are two different types of database management systems that have distinct characteristics and are suitable for different use cases. Here are some key differences between MySQL and NoSQL:
1.	Data Model:
•	MySQL: MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) that follows a structured data model. It organizes data into tables with predefined schemas, and relationships between tables are established through primary and foreign keys.
•	NoSQL: NoSQL databases employ a variety of data models, including document-oriented, key-value, columnar, and graph databases. They provide flexibility in data storage and allow for schema-less or dynamic schemas.
2.	Scalability:
•	MySQL: MySQL traditionally scales vertically, meaning it performs well on a single server with increased hardware resources (CPU, memory, etc.). It can handle a significant amount of data, but scaling beyond the capacity of a single server can be challenging.
•	NoSQL: NoSQL databases are designed for horizontal scalability. They distribute data across multiple servers or nodes, allowing them to handle large amounts of data and high traffic loads efficiently. NoSQL databases excel in distributed and cloud-based environments.
3.	Schema:
•	MySQL: MySQL enforces a rigid schema where the table structure is predefined. Changes to the schema require altering the table structure, which may impact the existing data.
•	NoSQL: NoSQL databases offer schema flexibility. They allow dynamic schemas, enabling developers to store different types of data with varying structures within the same database collection or table. This flexibility is advantageous in scenarios where data requirements evolve frequently.
4.	Query Language:
•	MySQL: MySQL employs Structured Query Language (SQL) as its primary query language. SQL provides a standardized syntax for querying and manipulating data in relational databases.
•	NoSQL: NoSQL databases often have their query languages optimized for specific data models. For example, MongoDB uses a query language similar to JSON called MongoDB Query Language (MQL). Other NoSQL databases may use custom query APIs or provide language-specific interfaces for data access.
5.	ACID Compliance:
•	MySQL: MySQL follows ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, which ensure data integrity and reliability. It guarantees that transactions are executed reliably, and the database remains in a consistent state.
•	NoSQL: NoSQL databases prioritize scalability and performance over strict ACID compliance. They often adopt a trade-off model, providing different levels of data consistency and durability, such as eventual consistency or relaxed durability guarantees. This approach allows for greater scalability and performance in distributed environments.

### 5) Explain any one DBMS Technology in your own words. 
Soln. One popular DBMS technology is MongoDB. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that falls under the category of document-oriented databases. It differs from traditional relational databases like MySQL by using a flexible and schema-less data model.

In MongoDB, data is organized into collections, which are analogous to tables in a relational database. However, unlike tables, collections can store documents with varying structures. Each document is a JSON-like object that contains key-value pairs, allowing for a more dynamic and flexible representation of data.

One of the key advantages of MongoDB is its ability to handle unstructured or semi-structured data. It can store and retrieve data in its natural form without requiring a predefined schema. This flexibility is particularly useful in scenarios where the data schema may change frequently or when dealing with diverse data types.

MongoDB also provides powerful querying capabilities. It supports a rich query language that allows for complex queries, including filtering, sorting, and aggregation operations. Additionally, MongoDB's query language provides support for geospatial queries, text search, and other specialized features.

Another notable feature of MongoDB is its horizontal scalability. It is designed to scale out by distributing data across multiple servers or nodes, allowing for high availability and performance. MongoDB achieves scalability through a process called sharding, where data is partitioned and distributed across multiple shards or clusters.

MongoDB also offers a variety of advanced features, including automatic sharding, replication for data redundancy and fault tolerance, and support for distributed transactions.

Overall, MongoDB provides a flexible, scalable, and high-performance solution for managing document-oriented data. Its ability to handle diverse and evolving data structures, combined with its rich querying capabilities and scalability features, makes it a popular choice for modern applications with complex data requirements.
